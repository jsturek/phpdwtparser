This package generates php class files (objects) from Dreamweaver template files. Examples found under `docs/examples/`.

## Test browser output (`basic/example_style1.php`):

* Open `docs/examples/basic/example_style1.php` in a browser.
* Builds a webpage object based on a class file that was previously generated by `createTemplates.php`.
    - The member variables of this object are editable regions that should be modified as desired.
* This uses `TemplateStyle1.php` and `Template_style1.tpl` that have been pregenerated.

## Test template creation:

````bash
cd docs/examples/basic/
php ../../../bin/createTemplates.php example.ini
````

This will write new versions of `TemplateStyle1.php` and `Template_style1.tpl` to `docs/examples/basic/`

## Scanner (`scanner_example.php`):

Scans a rendered DWT-based page for editable regions. All editable regions become member variables of the scanner object.
